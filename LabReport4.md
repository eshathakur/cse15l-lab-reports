**Step 4: Log into ieng6**
<br>Keys pressed: `<up><enter>`
<br>`ssh cs15lsp23le@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was up in my search history as I had just previously logged in to delete the existing lab7 directory.

<br>Summary: I logged into my ieng6 account, the up key was a shortcut so I didnt have to type it out and the enter key ran the command.

<br>**Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account**
<br>Keys pressed: `git<space>clone<space><command>v<enter>`
<br>I had the ssh clone url for lab7 copied to my clipboard and that is why I used `<command>v`

<br>Summary: I cloned my fork of the lab7 repository using the ssh key because this allows for both cloning and pushing to the repository.

<br>**Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**
<br>Keys pressed: `cd<space>lab7<enter>` `bash<space>test.sh<enter>` 
<br>![Image](step6.png)
<br>Summary: I changed the directory to lab7 then I ran the tests using the bash file test.sh to show that they fail.

<br>**Step 7:Edit the code file `ListExamples.java` to fix the failing test**

<br>**Step 8:Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed**

<br>**Step 9:Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account**
