<br>**Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**
<br>Keys pressed: `cd<space>lab7<enter>` `<command>v<enter>` `<command>v<space>ListExamplesTests` 
<br>I had copied the `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore`commands from the week 3 page of the class website.
