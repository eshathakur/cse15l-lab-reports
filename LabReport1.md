**Installing VScode:** I was fortunate and already had VScode downloaded because of a previous class. I remember I went to this url: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
Here is a screenshot of what the page should look like:![Image](VScode.png)
You should then be able to choose which directions you should need in order to download VScode.

**Remotely Connecting** I have a mac which already comes with git downloaded. In order to use the Bash in VScode for mac:
 <br> 1.Open VScode and open the terminal
 <br> 2.Open the command pallete using command + shift + P
 <br> 3.Type "select defualt profile"
 <br> 4.Select Bash from the options (should be the first one to pop up)
 <br> 5.Click the + icon in the terminal window
The new terminal is now a Git Bash terminal, the right hand side of the terminal should look like this: 
 <br> ![Image](Bash.png)

Then, to view your course-specific CSE15L account use this link: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) the page should look like this: 
![Image](AcctPage.png)
For the username enter what comes before the '@' in your UCSD student email, for example my email is esthakur@ucsd.edu, my username is esthakur
<br> For the password enter in your student PID (it starts with an A). Here is a link to reset your password, it includes images and directions that are very thorough: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view)
<br> You should set your password to something you will remember as you will have to enter it to log into the terminal.
<br>
<br> Next, to use ssh in VScode open the terminal and type in this command: ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu  and press enter
<br> the 'zz' should be replaced by the 2 specific letters assigned to you
<br>
<br>Since this will be the first time you are connecting to this server you will be prompted with a message asking if you want to continue connecting (shown in the screenshot below), type yes then press enter.
<br>It will then prompt you for your password, type it in then press enter, notice that it won't show up on the screen when you type it. In the screenshot below I had 2 failed attempts and that is okay. But the screenshot shows what your terminal will look like the first time you log in.

<br> Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any commands you run will run on that computer.



**Trying Some Commands:** here are some commands you can try out for fun, try and make note of what they do :
