**Installing VScode:** I was fortunate and already had VScode downloaded because of a previous class. I remember I went to this url: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
Here is a screenshot of what the page should look like:![Image](VScode.png)
You should then be able to choose which directions you should need in order to download VScode.

**Remotely Connecting** I have a mac which already comes with git downloaded. In order to use the Bashin VScode for mac:
1.Open VScode and open the terminal
2.Open the command pallete using command + shift + P
3.Type "select defualt profile"
4.Select Bash from the options (should be the first one to pop up)
5.Click the + icon in the terminal window
The new terminal is now a Git Bash terminal, the right hand side of the terminal should look like this: ![Image](Bash.png)

Then, to view your course-specific CSE15L account use this link: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) the page should look like this: 

Next, to use ssh in VScode open the terminal and type in this command: ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
the 'zz' should be replaced by the 2 specific letters assigned to you.
